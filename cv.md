### About myself

I've been a quality assurance engineer since December '21 and I love my job!
My main goal is to help customers and developers find ways to improve products.
My priority is to investigate the product and find all kinds of defects.
I am a very caring team worker, keeping an eye on the product. And I am a fast learner.
